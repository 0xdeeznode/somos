# SOMOS

Somos is a web application designed to unite small and large communities for the common good. Our mission is to spread awareness about local issues and showcase the incredible achievements a united community can accomplish.

## Overview

Somos serves as a platform where users can discover nearby issues, such as a park needing attention due to excessive trash. Users can view important details about each issue, such as the estimated time required to resolve it based on the number of participants and the tools needed, if any.

## Features

- **Discover Local Issues:** Find and explore issues in your community that need attention.
- **Detailed Information:** View comprehensive details about each issue, including estimated resolution time and required tools.
- **Join Campaigns:** Users can join campaigns to help solve these issues. Upon joining, they can invite others to participate.
- **Leadership:** The first user to join a campaign becomes the "leader." Leaders can transfer leadership to new members of the specific campaign.
- **Documentation and Sharing:** Leaders can document the progress and final results of their work. These updates can be uploaded to SOMOS and showcased on the main feed.
- **Rewards:** Contributions are rewarded with BAT tokens, calculated based on the progress made or the completion of the issue.

## Technologies Used

- **Django & Python:** Backend framework for building the core functionality.
- **React & JavaScript:** Frontend library and language for creating an interactive user interface.
